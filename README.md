#Strategy

My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible in a few steps to figure out where to go for the best speciality coffee in Dublin and Ireland. I wanted to make simple and minimal but fun and colourful maintaining a user-friendly design and most importantly mobile first approach.

##Scope

For users, I wanted to provide a quick, simple and fun guide of the best speciality coffee shops in Dublin and Ireland, with all the information the need to find the location and with the potential to expand the website to a bigger lists of coffee shops. A link to googlemaps location of each cafe, social media links and a short description of the place. Additionally a contact form, so if people would like to suggest to add a new cafe in town it can be add it by the owner of the website to expand the data base of coffee shops.

#Structure

In the cafe section on the home page, I wanted the users to be able to select which district of dublin or ireland the want to explore coffee shops. This way the lists of coffee shops is better organized and easy access depending of the area, including a direct link to google maps for find the location of the cafe easily. Additionally a link to social media and opening times.



#Surface

A four high contrast colour palette was chosen to create a fun experience but maintaining a simple and minimal look and feel. I use two fonts for the design, the firs font “” for titles and the second font “” for the rest of text content.
